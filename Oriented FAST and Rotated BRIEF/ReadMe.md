# Oriented FAST and Rotated BRIEF üìù
## Overview
**ORB** is a combination of **FAST** keypoint detector and a **BRIEF** descriptor with additional performance fixes. This method applies the **FAST** technique to identify the keypoints followed by the measurement of the top *n* points using the **Harris Corner Method**.

* **OpenCV** has an **ORB()** function that can use a *feature2d common* interface.
