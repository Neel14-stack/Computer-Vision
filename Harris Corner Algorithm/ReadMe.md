# Harris Corner Algorithm 📝

## Overview
In 1988 Chris Harris and Mike Stephens developed this algorithm that can perform both **Edge Detection** and **Corner Detection**. Hence, this algorithm was named after one of the authors.
- This algorithm helps identify the inside corner of an image by checking the area that has maximum variations in intensity.
- In **OpenCV**, the **cv2.cornerHarris()** function is used to achieve the corner detection.
