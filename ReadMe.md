## Overview üìù
  
**Computer vision** is the field of computer science that focuses on replicating parts of the complexity of the human vision system and enabling computers to identify and process objects in images and videos in the same way that humans do.

Detecting objects in an image is a crucial capability of a **Computer Vision** application.
While humans can identify a variety of objects effortlessly, for **computers** it is a complex problem to solve with accuracy. It has eluded **computer vision** researchers for decades now and has become the holy grail of **Computer Vision**.
